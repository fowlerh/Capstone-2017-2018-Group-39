\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to give an overview of what parts of the ConnectBasket project Taylor Kirkpatrick will have responsibility over,
and analyze the technologies that may be used for each part. Each part will choose a specific technology that may be used in the final project, 
along with justification for why.


\subsection{Scope}
ConnectBasket will be a web based portal for the OSU Veterinary Hospital that will streamline the way messages are moved around the hospital and 
provide a better way to track the route that messages have taken. When an owner calls the hospital, receptionists will be able to type a message 
into the computer, assign it a category, and route it to the necessary staff members, which may be service specific vet techs, house officers, or 
faculty. Those staff members will be alerted, either by email or text, that they have a message waiting for them in ConnectBasket, and once viewed, 
notes can be added and the message can be re-routed to other staff members. After a message has been addressed by the necessary staff, the message 
can be closed, meaning no more notes can be added. The audit trail of when the message was created and closed will be visible, along with all the 
notes, timestamps of notes, and staff who added the notes.


\subsection{Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Capstone - CS 461 class at Oregon State that the developers of ConnectBasket are in
 
\item OSU - Oregon State University

\item Hospital - referring to the OSU Veterinary Hospital

\item Owner - a person who owns a pet that is a client of the hospital

\item Patient - an animal who has/is going to be treated at the hospital 

\item VetHosp - the hospital management system used by the OSU Veterinary Hospital for keeping patient and owner records

\item Mobile Devices - smartphones or tablets

\subsection{Overview}
The rest of the document will contain three sections with an overview of the parts of the ConnectBasket project Taylor Kirkpatrick 
is responsible for. Each section will contain five subsections, three to analyze specific technologies, one to compare them, and one 
to state the chosen technology with project-specific reasoning.

\section{User Logins/Profiles}
A feature highly anticipated by the client, users must have persistent, personalized states to distinguish them from other users when tasks are to be 
passed on. These user profiles must be private and secure, one to each user. Messages may be user-specific and carry information that is confidential 
or otherwise not to be made accessible to everyone, even within the company. This part specifies what framework or project will be built off of to 
create these users and their logins and profiles. Of note is the possible overlap this system may have with the issue tracking technology, as those are 
usually distributed as whole projects, including user logins. While we do expect to be using one of these frameworks, it may clash with what the issue tracker 
framework brings to the table.
\subsection{Userfrosting}
Userfrosting is a very neat and full user framework for PHP. It depends on the PHP tool Composer and also makes use of Node.js and Bower for client-side packages.
The framework fully automates and handles persistent user sessions without requiring the dev team to handle sessions manually between many potentially dynamically updating 
pages. Userfrosting also adds easily customizable and rather nice looking user profile pages, allowing a dev to simply present some information to users under the conditions 
that they desire. In addition, this framework provides simple methods for a dev to create user roles for role based control, and assign users to them. Lastly, the framework 
allows the creation of a user administration page for user operations. This interface can be easily built for non-technical users, and ease the process of user administration 
for them.
\subsection{HUGE}
HUGE is a PHP framework for doing simple user authentication. HUGE came about in a time when PHP was lacking many quality login solutions, and was built
primarily off of the password_compat library once it was released. HUGE is no longer in active development, but has remained an excellent choice when facing 
up against many other PHP frameworks. HUGE makes use of the official PHP password hashing functions, with many other nice features that one would expect in a 
login framework like email account verification, form encryption, a "remember me" function, etc. HUGE also offers many other nice features like URL rewriting 
(masking possibly sensitive info), and supports user portraits already. HUGE requires PHP 5.5 or above, a MySQL database, a handful of PHP extentions, a few 
developer tools, and software for sending mail if desired.
\subsection{ASP.NET Identity}
ASP.NET includes a relatively robust user login API for use in ASP.NET projects. As this project may be done in ASP.NET, this is something worth checking. As the web
became wider and demanded even better user management support, ASP.NET created the framework ASP.NET Identity to keep up with alternatives, offering full support with
other ASP.NET packages along with the expected features in a login framework. Playing well with other ASP.NET packages is not to be underestimated, however, as a project 
built in ASP.NET is sure to have numerous other packages. The framework does, of course, support simple login features, along with more advanced things like social media 
integration and a persistent "remember me" cookie login, and role based control.
\subsection{Comparison}
At a first glance, it appears that ASP.NET Identity lacks features compared to the other two options, and this observation is correct. However, it does boast the reliability of
Microsoft's products, and development with it in Visual Studio would be easier than the other two. Between the other two, Userfrosting is much more hands-off than HUGE, and 
while doing less complex and error prone work is nice, it also restricts the freedom of the developers. HUGE and Userfrosting have very similar features available, but HUGE may 
even boast more features. However, HUGE was never really formally released as anything other than a simple open source framework. Identity and Userfrosting are both more formal 
projects, and may not be as bug prone.
\subsection{Selection}
The HUGE framework is the tentative winner in this category. It is a happy medium between the hands-off GUIs of Userfrosting and the mostly manual configuration of ASP.NET Identity.
HUGE has roughly the same number of features as the other two combined, is much better documented than both, and has many years of fellow users for support that Identity may
not have, and Userfrosting is unlikely to have. This victory comes with a caveat, however, as it is dependent on what language the software is in. Should the dev team be unable to
use PHP, or otherwise choose not to in favor of ASP.NET or something else, HUGE would be useless for the project. Of the three present here, however, it is the better of them, 
while the others provide options should other development decisions invalidate HUGE as an option.

% SMS Service: - Taylor
% Plivo
% Twilio
% Nexmo (I just googled around for these names, I know nothing about any of them. But they could be possibilities if we don’t want to do it manually)
% User profile framework: - Taylor
% Userfrosting (This thing works out of the box, which means less work for us. I like it.)
% HUGE (Something I found on github)
% Do users manually (please no)
% Issue Tracker Framework: (Since that’s pretty much what they are asking us to make. If we choose to just put one on a server and interact with it via our custom website, these are some options for that.) - Taylor
% Redmine (Simple and open source, but it’s in Ruby, and I don’t like Ruby.)
% OTRS (More aimed toward IT and such, but looks fine)
% Request Tracker (bestpractical is the company that made it. More aimed toward non-technical, which is what we want.)
% Do it manually (Not impossible, but why reinvent the wheel?)
